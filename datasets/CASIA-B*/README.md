# CASIA-B\*
CASIA-B\* is a re-segmented version of CASIA-B processed by Liang et al. The extra import of CASIA-B* owes to the background subtraction algorithm that CASIA-B uses for generating the silhouette data tends to produce much noise and is outdated for real-world applications nowadays. We use the up-to-date pretreatment strategy to re-segment the raw videos, i.e., the deep pedestrian track and segmentation algorithms. As a result, CASIA-B\* consists of the cropped RGB images, binary silhouettes, and the height-width ratio of the obtained bounding boxes. Please refer to [GaitEdge](../../configs/gaitedge/README.md) for more details.
